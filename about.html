             <h2>Smoothies</h2>
             <p>Steve Kuhnau (founder of the first Smoothie King in louisiana) branded the name smoothie hence referring to how fruit juices were made by hippies. It maybe a myth or an irony that smoothies have been made years before as pureed fruit drinks, until the blender and the refrigerator were invented that now smoothies are easily made. In the 1930s Health food stores on the West Coast of the United States began selling smoothies. It was only in the 1980s that the name "smoothies" were its official name. </p>

             <h2>Why did i choose Smoothies?</h2>
             <p>When I was around 6, I tried my first smoothie from a smoothie shop. Ever since then, I wanted to get another smoothie. It was when I was 8 when I found out that I can make my very own. When I heard this at first, I was confused, but when my parents showed me how a blender looked online, I was begging to get one. I wanted a smoothie every day! I wanted to make my own smoothies. In late 2017, I got my first blender. That day, I was very happy, I finally got a blender, now I can make any smoothie I wanted to. Ever since, my dad and I worked on making smoothies together, and soon my sister when she was old enough. After years, and years of trying, inventing, and making smoothies, I gathered enough recipes to make a website full of them. The recipes I chose arent just any recipes, theyre the special ones. The ones that have a nice feel to them. The kind that for every sip you take, you want three more.</p>

             <h2>Where can i get smoothie materials?</h2>
             <p>Before making a smoothie, you may want to know where to get the materials, or maybe your wondering what the materials are exactly? First lets state the obvious, you need a blender. This is the essential to making a smoothie. Unless of course you want to use your hands, which I dont recomend especially if your serving it to anyone else due to the amount of germs that may be in it once you finish. You also need a fridge to keep it cold if you want more later, if you want it to keep cold while its ouside, you can add ice. You want to have Cups or glasses to serve them in if you're having guests. If its just you, you can simply put it in any bottle and keep it with you wherever you go. Regarding your ingreedients, you need a cutting board to cut your ingreedients, because some fruits/veggies require cutting. For instance strawberries, you normally want to cut off the tip. Or in some fruits you just need to have it cut. With that said, you need a knife to cut your ingreedients. Below are some websites you can visit to get most of these items.  </p>
